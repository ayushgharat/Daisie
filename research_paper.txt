Here's a summary of the key points from the research paper "Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease from on-line handwriting: A novel dataset and performance benchmarking":
Introduction:
The paper introduces DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting), a new dataset for Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection using handwriting analysis.
Handwriting analysis can be an effective, cheap, and non-invasive method for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases like AD.
Dataset:
DARWIN contains handwriting samples from 174 participants (89 AD patients, 85 healthy controls).
Participants were matched for age, education level, type of work, and gender.
The dataset includes data from 25 different handwriting tasks designed to target different brain areas.
Data Collection:
Used a Wacom Bamboo tablet with an ink pen on A4 paper.
Recorded x-y coordinates, pressure, and timestamps at 200 Hz.
Collected both on-paper and in-air movements (up to 3 cm above paper).
Features:
Extracted 18 features for each task, including timing, kinematic, and pressure-related measures.
Features capture various aspects of handwriting dynamics.

 here are more details on the testing criteria and the 25 tests used:
The handwriting data collection protocol included 25 tasks divided into three main categories:
Graphic tasks: Tested participants' ability in writing elementary traits.
Copy tasks: Evaluated participants' abilities in repeating complex graphic gestures with semantic meaning.
Memory and dictation tasks: Tested changes in writing process for previously memorized content or content associated with shown objects, and investigated how handwriting varies when using working memory.
The 25 specific tasks were:
Signature drawing (Memory)
Join two points with a horizontal line, continuously for four times (Graphic)
Join two points with a vertical line, continuously for four times (Graphic)
Retrace a circle (6 cm diameter) continuously for four times (Graphic)
Retrace a circle (3 cm diameter) continuously for four times (Graphic)
Copy the letters 'l', 'm' and 'p' (Copy)
Copy the letters on the adjacent rows (Copy)
Write cursively a sequence of four lowercase letter 'l', in a single smooth movement (Copy)
Write cursively a sequence of four lowercase cursive bigram 'le', in a single smooth movement (Copy)
Copy the word "foglio" (Copy)
Copy the word "foglio" above a line (Copy)
Copy the word "mamma" (Copy)
Copy the word "mamma" above a line (Copy)
Memorize the words "telefono", "cane", and "negozio" and rewrite them (Memory)
Copy in reverse the word "bottiglia" (Copy)
Copy in reverse the word "casa" (Copy)
Copy six words (regular, non-regular, non-words) in the appropriate boxes (Copy)
Write the name of the object shown in a picture (a chair) (Memory)
Copy the fields of a postal order (Copy)
Write a simple sentence under dictation (Dictation)
Retrace a complex form (Graphic)
Copy a telephone number (Copy)
Write a telephone number under dictation (Dictation)
Draw a clock, with all hours and put hands at 11:05 (Clock Drawing Test) (Graphic)
Copy a paragraph (Copy)
These tasks were designed to target different brain areas involved in fine motor planning and execution that may be affected by Alzheimer's disease. The variety of tasks aimed to elicit different aspects of handwriting movements, providing a comprehensive characterization of the participants' handwriting abilities.

Experimental Setup:
Evaluated 9 different classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, and Learning Vector Quantization.
Performed experiments using individual tasks and combinations of tasks.
Used 5-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
Results:
Best overall accuracy achieved was 88.29% using Random Forest on combined features from all tasks.
Different tasks and classifiers showed varying performance, suggesting complementary information from different tasks.
Combining classifiers from individual tasks improved performance for most models.
Conclusions:
The DARWIN dataset provides a comprehensive resource for AD detection research using handwriting analysis.
The proposed protocol and feature set effectively capture distinctive aspects of AD patients' handwriting.
Combining multiple tasks and classifiers yields better performance than single-task approaches.
This paper presents a novel dataset and benchmark for AD detection using handwriting analysis, demonstrating the potential of this approach for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.
